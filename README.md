# Yelp Scraper and Mailer

A set of two procedural scripts for Yelp marketing.

The first script, ruby-yelp-scraper.rb, scrapes Yelp to gather the business info and URLs.

With this information, you can manually retrieve email addresses.  These addresses can then be used in conjuction with ruby-yelp-mailer.rb to send out automated mass mailers to those people you scraped from Yelp.
